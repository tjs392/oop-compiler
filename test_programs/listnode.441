# This code pushes a few values on a stack, then pops and prints in reverse order
# So this should print 9, then 5, then 3, then 1, then 0 (which is the default the stack returns when popping an empty stack)
# Global value numbering on the main routine should remove a lot of pointer tag checks, and consequently result in fewer basic blocks for main.
# If you have implemented value numbering for field map and vtbl lookups, most of those will also be removed.
# A smaller number of tag checks will be removed from the code of the stack methods.
